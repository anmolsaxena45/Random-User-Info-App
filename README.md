# Random-User-Info-App

A simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays random user data using an API call. On button click, the app retrieves a random user’s profile image, name, and email, and displays them dynamically on the page.

This project is ideal for beginners to learn API integration, fetch requests, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. It demonstrates how to work with external data sources in a clean and user-friendly interface.
